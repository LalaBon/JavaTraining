class Main {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
		
		String pal = "gorod dorog";
		int startPos=0;
		int endPos = pal.length() -1;
		
		boolean isPal = true;
		
		while(startPos < endPos)
		{
			String startLetter = pal.substring(startPos, startPos+1);
			String endLetter = pal.substring(endPos, endPos+1);
			
			            if(startLetter.equals(endLetter)==false)
			{
			   isPal=false;
			   break;

			startPos++;
			endPos--;
